    \subsection{Jenkins/JCasC/Groovy/YAML/Python 3/Qemu/KVM/ZFS/GNU make\\
    ATP/ETCS {\small since 09/2022}}
    My current project involves infrastructure development and optimization
    for major international railway industry leader and its subsidiaries.
    I am a part of the team that introduces DevOps culture to the organization
    by moving semi-manual workloads from legacy systems (IBM Synology)
    to tailored, fully automated pipelines, based on git, GitLab, and Jenkins.
    Meanwhile we migrate and optimize parts of CI/CD infrastructure
    from data centers in Germany to Sweden.
    
    \subsection{GCP/GKE/dbt/BigQuery/Python/Docker Desktop {\small 03/2022-08/2022}}
    My last project for GFT involved implementation of the dbt-based tool that would
    ease the reporting management and execution through kubernetes jobs on
    BigQuery Engine.  End user interface employed Docker Desktop and set of
    Windows wrapper scripts.  I played a role of DevOps engineer.
    \vspace{0.5em}
    
    \subsection{Python/PySpark/Pandas/Bash/Jenkins pipelines {\small 11/2020-02/2022}}
    The project goal was to migrate reporting process from RDBMS to PySpark.
    My role there was to develop and optimize CI/CD toolkit to perform routine
    tasks and enforce policies.  My key achievement was a tool that would ensure
    non-decreasing Python code test coverage through Jenkins pipelines integrated with
    git (here: BitBucket) code repository.
    \vspace{0.5em}
    
    \subsection{Linux/Java/Maven/SonarQube {\small 06/2020}}
    My task was to help a team to assess legacy code quality for a prospective
    project.  To this end, I set up the SonarQube, performed the analysis and
    discussed the result with requesting team, while presenting them with the tool.
    \vspace{0.5em}
    
    \subsection{SaltStack/Consul/Consul template/Vault/nginx/Proxmox/git\\
    VMWare/MySQL/Ansible/Jenkins/Linux/Bash {\small 02/2020-06/2020}}
    My role was to join an existing team and help them reduce technical debt
    their long-running project had generated over years; propose robust,
    reliable and performant backup solution; rectify/automate manual procedures etc.
    \vspace{0.5em}
        
    \subsection{Artifactory/Azure/Docker/Maven/NuGet/npm/git/\\
    Windows Server/Microsoft SQL Server {\small 01/2018-03/2018}}
    My role was to set up Artifactory HA cluster in Azure Cloud as PoC and on Client
    private cloud, configure it as repository proxy/emulator for various items,
    integrate with company AD and document all of the above in Confluence.
    \vspace{0.5em}
    
    \subsection{Java/Oracle DB/PostgreSQL/Angular/Docker/TeamCity/git/Go\\
    SonarQube/Bash/Python/AMQ/RedHat Linux {\small 12/2015-02/2020}}
    I played a role of the Support Lead in client Support Team as well as leading
    DevOps officer.  I was responsible for production releases, process automation,
    provisioning and maintaining of developer and CI environments for the
    application.  I was also in charge of database-related tasks such as overseeing
    issues with the vendor (Oracle), securely migrating data between
    environments (prod to non-prod cloning) and between vendors (migration from
    Oracle to PostgreSQL).  However, my key achievement in that project was a
    versatile controlling tool for the application we supported, that would provide
    a uniform way to control, provision, deploy, upgrade all components across all
    environments and servers.  I proposed, designed, co-developed and maintained
    this tool, which is still being used by the team.
    \vspace{0.5em}
    
    \subsection{Java/CentOS Linux/JBoss/AMQ/PHP/MySQL/Apache/Python\\
    Bash/SVN/Jenkins/Java EE/Memcache/Drupal {\small 05/2014-11/2015}}
    The project goal was to prepare new version of product marketing platform
    and migrate it from JavaEE/JBoss/Oracle stack to Drupal/Apache/PHP/MySQL.
    The task wasn't trivial, since the platform provides complete information
    about products offered by the client, including current and historical
    information about composition, performance, intra-day quotes etc., comprised from
    various and numerous sources.  Hence the new version was a complete application rewrite
    with enhanced security, flexibility, ease of administration and performance in mind.
    My role was to establish production and pre-production environments, design release
    procedures, and making sure we were using the best technologies available in open
    source ecosystem of the era; as well as training team members, supervising releases,
    documenting, analysing and discussing with developers releases outcome etc.

    so that the new device would be even more competitive and 100\% EU law compliant.

    help design an interface module, capable of communicating with
    modern information media and fully compliant with normative regulations

    my primary focus was Linux servers and databases administration.
    This quickly expanded to also cover communication interfaces development,
    since moving official communication from paper to web was beneficial
    for everyone (including the Department I worked for).
    
    Using MySQL I have designed a database model of state examination processes,
    which was later used to build all user communication interfaces
    during next four years.

% Demonstrate what an \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}} page looks like.
% Also show off the macros for publications that uses small icons for authors, date, journal and links.

% Achieving a good looking spacing can be tricky. For empty pagestyles where the full width is available use \texttt{\textbackslash pubforcefullwidth} to force the publoication list to take up all the available space.
% The (relative) lengths reserved for date, journal and links can be set with the parameters \texttt{\textbackslash pubdatelength}, \texttt{\textbackslash pubjournallength} and \texttt{\textbackslash publinklength} as in \texttt{\textbackslash setlength\{\textbackslash pubdatelength\}\{0.15 \textbackslash linewidth\}}.
